# CrowdStrike Cloud Security

This guide is for customers who are building a CrowdStrike Cloud Security integration solution using the AWS Built-In (ABI) program. It walks you through the process of onboarding your AWS organization with CrowdStrike Cloud Security.

ABI is a differentiation program that validates AWS Partner solutions that have automated their integrations with relevant AWS foundational services such as identity, management, security, and operations. It helps customers find and deploy a validated partner solution that addresses specific customer use cases while providing deep visibility and control of AWS native service integration.
