* **ABI :**  AWS Built-In (ABI).
* **ABI modules :** The GitHub repositories based on [AWS Security Reference Architecture](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/security-reference-architecture/welcome.html) (AWS SRA). Modules provide templates for enabling AWS foundational services such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, AWS Security Hub, etc.
* **ABI solutions :** The GitHub repositories built by partners in collaboration with AWS. While building these solution, partners use ABI modules to enable AWS services as needed before creating partner-specific assets. The solution contains (1) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates to automate enablement of both AWS and partner services, and (2) wrappers for most common formats such as CfCT manifest, AWS Service Catalog baselines, and more, so customers can pick and choose from the available services.
* **Assessment:** An individual instance when CrowdStrike compares your cloud settings to the CSPM policies.
* **Assessment schedules:** You can select how frequently your cloud environment is assessed for misconfigurations. You can also exclude AWS services and Regions from assessment.
* **Behavioral:** Patterns of suspicious behavior in your cloud environment.
* **Configuration:** Findings based on policies and benchmarks compared to your cloud configuration.
* **CrowdStrike API client:** CrowdStrike Falcon API client authentication credentials for interaction with CrowdStike APIs via OAuth 2.0 token. Includes an API client ID and API client secret.
* **CrowdStrike event bus:** The AWS event bus in CrowdStrike's environment for receiving events and providing the data to CrowdStrike Cloud Security service.
* **CSPM policies:** A set of rules defined to detect misconfigurations of the cloud resources (IOMs) or to detect suspicious behavior patterns (IOAs).
* **ECR Registry Connections:** 
* **Indicator of attack (IOA):** A pattern of suspicious behavior that suggests an attack might be underway. In CrowdStrike Cloud Security, IOAs are labeled as findings.
* **Indicator of misconfiguration (IOM):** A configuration setting that doesnâ€™t follow recommended security guidelines and might become a security vulnerability in a cloud environment. In CrowdStrike Cloud Security, IOMs are labeled as findings.
* **Registration:** Enroll your AWS account ID with the CrowdStrike Cloud Security service.
* **Sensor Management:** Enable 1-click sensor deployment to quickly and easily deploy the Falcon sensor to your cloud workloads. Use the Deployment dashboard to discover unmanaged AWS hosts and unregistered AWS accounts and to kick start workflows to register your cloud accounts and automate sensor deployments.
* **SSM Distributor:** Install the Falcon sensor on instances across your AWS accounts using AWS SSM State Manager Associations.
