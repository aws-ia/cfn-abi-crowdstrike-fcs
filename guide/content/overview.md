This [AWS Built-In](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/built-in-partner-solutions/) (ABI) solution deploys CrowdStrike Cloud Security integrations for AWS Organizations on the AWS Cloud. It’s for IT administrators and security professionals who want to provide endpoint protection and Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) across multiple AWS accounts.

Deploying this ABI solution doesn't guarantee an organization’s compliance with any laws, certifications, policies, or other regulations.

Protect endpoints with an intelligent, lightweight agent that consolidates point products and stops advanced attacks — both malware and malware-free — while capturing rich endpoint activity for industry-leading detection and response.

Avoid breaches and make sure your cloud security configuration meets industry security recommendations with CrowdStrike Cloud Security. Cloud Security monitors your cloud services to detect critical security issues, common configuration errors, and patterns of suspicious behavior. Triage findings and find recommended remediations to close the gaps and keep your cloud data secure.

Get started using Cloud Security by registering your cloud accounts. When registering, CrowdStrike is granted limited read-only access to your cloud account. When registering your ABI solution, all accounts in that organization are registered automatically.
