This [AWS Built-In](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/built-in-partner-solutions/) (ABI) solution deploys CrowdStrike integrations for AWS Organizations on the AWS Cloud. It's for IT administrators and security professionals who want to provide endpoint protection, container image assessment, and EKS cluster security across multiple AWS accounts.

Deploying this ABI solution doesn't guarantee an organization's compliance with any laws, certifications, policies, or other regulations.

Protect endpoints with an intelligent, lightweight agent that consolidates point products and stops advanced attacks — both malware and malware-free — while capturing rich endpoint activity for industry-leading detection and response.

Assess container images in Amazon ECR for vulnerabilities and malware before deployment, helping ensure only secure images are used in your environment.

Secure your Amazon EKS clusters with runtime protection that monitors for suspicious activities and provides visibility into containerized workloads.

Get started by registering your AWS accounts with CrowdStrike. When registering, CrowdStrike is granted limited read-only access to your cloud account. When deploying this ABI solution, all accounts in that organization are registered automatically.
