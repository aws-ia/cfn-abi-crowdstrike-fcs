### CrowdStrike Falcon cost and licenses

* [CrowdStrike Bundles and Pricing](https://www.crowdstrike.com/products/?ct-q2-2023-bn-products-nav)
* [CrowdStrike Terms and Conditions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/EULA/314ae52f-b319-4413-9052-fe03bfbd6b21-Crowdstrike-EULA.pdf)


### AWS service cost
In addition to the CrowdStrike Falcon cost, consider costs associated with the AWS services you choose and the scale of your operations. AWS services such as CloudTrail, Lambda, Amazon S3, and AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) may have associated costs.

### ABI cost and licenses

Using ABI doesn't incur additional charges. You are charged only for the resources that ABI consumes. If other ABI licenses are required for your specific use case, obtain those separately.
